2024.08.21AJK Onsite visit with customer to see overall operation. They run the machine during all 3 shifts. Customer is overall happy with the niche that our solution fits into, but their biggest pain point was pricing. Their other vendors have not increased their prices this year likely due to their large volume. They do not do as significant amount of volume with us like they do their other vendors so they likely have more flexibility on pricing. Will review their cash flow with Chris to see what we can do here.

Sales Call: Had a call with Dean, humanscale has three manufacturing sites.  One in NJ, one in Mexico and one in Dublin, we only have machines in two sites.  They use the machine everyday except for one shift a week.  They only use it for inserts inside tthe boxes.  They don't use it for packages that go out to customers as they do not like the glue outside the box and we cannot print on the box the way they would like it. Also, the machine cannot do angle cuts, so they do not want to move forward with using it more.  When I mentioned a rebate to use it more, he was interested.  They think that the volume they did in 2024 is more of an accurate VC, however with the cloud upgrade they may be able to do more.  Dean said they run completely separate from their Nogales site.  He is a waiting on his IT team to get the cloud amendment signed.  He does not know the info on how they buy glue or the inventory, but will get me in touch with the correct contacts.

6/6/24 - NJO - We continue to retain 100% of box share. In 2023, DecksDirect acquired DIY Homecenter and undertook the process of bringing the volume into the whitestown DC. This has led to a volume increase since Dec 2023, and the customer is still sitting on a $130k approved Capex to automate the warehouse and move to box first with Packsize.

(JB - 7/7/21) - While Packsize continues to retain 100% of DecksDirect corrugated/box business, we are growing closer to putting ourselves at risk due to extremely high trim rates (30% currently).  Laura Kueny is growing very frustrated with trim and overall corrugated costs.  I am actively working with the SE and SIE teams to put a plan in place to eliminate this issue.

Good morning, QBP team,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. Below are the action items from my visit:

Ensure all future bale deliveries have one pallet per bale. This has been confirmed that this change has been made.
Review past engineer site visit logs.
Address bale trapping concerns with the CSC location.
On-site visits:  Monthly visits are not necessary, but we welcome monthly conference calls.
 Delivery leads times. Currently at 3 days. I will inform your team if that changes during peak season.
Please let me know if I missed anything. Thank you for your continued business and partnership with Packsize.

Best regards,
David

The Housing Market ""Start"" dip of October 2022 hit KW extra hard. In addition to a bad housing market, KW's top customer, Wolf Home Products, cancelled 99% of their business with KW, electing to open another mfg. facility in an attempt to produce cabinets of their own. In January 2023, KW held a vendor partner meeting where they double downed on being an American Cabinet Maker and declined to make any cost-cutting efforts in an attempt to grow their market share. They estimated they would close 2023 at -12% YOY, but they closed 2023 closer to -40% YOY. They have increased their sales presence and are actively trying to work with new distributors, but to date, their sales are still stagnant.

Packsize will be splitting the machines as we discussed. We will be back in touch with next steps on that initiative. You will be left with two separate and fully redundant Packsize machines, EM735 and EM725, that can operate together or independently.

You are currently using a 55"" bale and 44.5"" bale thus rendering the EM725 too small to hold both bales and truly operate as an independent machine.

6/6/24 - NJO - The housing market ""starts"" took a dramatic dip in October 2022 that saw many cabinet customers falter to all time low volumes. Smart cabinetry was the opposite, picking up additional business from competitors that were struggling. This caused them to peak in December 2023, and to the start of 2024, we have seen a gradual correction. That said, Smart has been very stable for many years. Additionally, they have purchased the farmland beside their building and are currently planning an expansion that would see them double capacity to 10,000 cabinets/day by 2030. The plans are not confirmed, but the land purchase leads me to believe the project is being seriously considered.

Replace the current 2.5-meter (EM725) machine with a 3.5-meter (EM735) new generation machine (see attached ""EM735""). This would allow better optimization of materials to accomplish lower scrap rates. This equipment would also allow for a much larger range of cartons produced. Currently, the department has a need for larger cartons that cannot be satisfied with the current EM725 box machine. Furthermore, the 4-foot auto gluer can be swapped with an 8-foot gluer (see attached ""8-foot Auto Gluer"") to eliminate the current carton gluing size limitation.

2.) I also recommend a dimensioning system (see attached ""DIM2SHIP""). These are very inexpensive and allow the Packsize operator to quickly scan LxWxH and automatically send dimensions to the Packsize machine for production. Currently, the operator is using a tape measure and walking to the machine for manual entry. 

3.) Remove the second machine. It is not being used and currently takes up valuable space on the floor.

- Updated SLA was delivered to the customer (Neal) for review.
- Phase 2 integration had some hiccups. There was a latency issue with data moving across the network, every time a label or box would try to print the machine would pause. 
Possible Solutions moving forward:
- Add an external print server 
- Add standalone servers for each machine for redundancy and to isolate machines on a local network versus having data travel across the network.

The Housing Market ""Start"" dip of October 2022 hit KW extra hard. In addition to a bad housing market, KW's top customer, Wolf Home Products, cancelled 99% of their business with KW, electing to open another mfg. facility in an attempt to produce cabinets of their own. In January 2023, KW held a vendor partner meeting where they double downed on being an American Cabinet Maker and declined to make any cost-cutting efforts in an attempt to grow their market share. They estimated they would close 2023 at -12% YOY, but they closed 2023 closer to -40% YOY. They have increased their sales presence and are actively trying to work with new distributors, but to date, their sales are still stagnant.

Everything is great and they expect business to jump 10 percent.  They currently do about 60 percent of their business on the Packsize Machine.  The reason that we only have 60 percent of their business is that they have a couple of heavy hitter boxes that if they made them it would clog up the machine and they would not be able to produce all of them.  I did suggest a second machine but they do not have the room for it.  They do alot of bale swaping so i did suggest the 650, still might have a space issue.  They are buying their boxes from Liberty Packaging.

Dale

2/21/24: Via Brooke M. 
Exel is a tricky account, adding a few others to make sure we draft the correct document needed.
​
1. Exel signed a master agreement that is JUST terms - no sites listed. 
2. They had us created a document we can use to add sites to these terms signed for in the master agreement (attached)
3. The only sites added so far are Nokia 104456, Brantford 100826, and DHL Cisco in PA 106076 (all attached)
4. Should we be doing an Order Form to add Joliet to this master with these changes? 
​
Joliet is only under an MOU, which we cannot continue to do business with and cannot write an amendment to. So, we either need to do an order form or draft a new contract.

2024.12.04. EK Sales Call: Anna spoke with Adam who intro'd us to Mark (purchasing mngr on Polyvinyl side). Polyvinyl acquired dura-trel recently and they need contract to be amended under the Polyvinyl name. They also want to transition from pre-payment to Net terms. They expect volume commitment to go down in 2025 for these reasons: 1) went from 70 skus down to the most popular 17 skus, 2) many of the larger items are no longer produced. We will revisit things in Q1 and I will multithread and get in touch with their plant manager to get box size data (Polyvinyl uses pre-cut boxes and not packsize).

Brian plans to revisit the presentation of the PAAS fee model once the volume improves and cost savings can be demonstrated, as the company is currently focused on cost-saving measures.

6/6/24 - NJO - Zanders sells outdoor equipment, specializing in hunting - guns and ammunition. They peaked during Covid when the market was stockpiling guns and ammo. Since their peak, they have seen a gradual decline for a number of years. The business has since stabilized as of the summer of 2023. They continue to ship ammunition in stock boxes, citing issues with the WMS cubing and process flow that ""eliminate the possibility of using Packsize"". Our champion (IT resource) left in early 2024, so previous momentum to do a project has stalled.

- If machine software goes down - what are expectations to get it up and running again? 
- Distinguish between software and hardware issues.  
- Better clarification for the root cause, if it happens once, what steps should be followed to prevent it from happening again. 
- The cost to change from Gold to Platinum

Performed a customer visit to inquire about low ramp. Low ramp is due to the fact they are not producing boxes for their taller base cabinets and lazy susan cabinets. 
Issue: 
- The cabinets are built away from the main line. So transporting the boxes from the main line to their staging area is difficult. 
Solution:
- Continue to work with the customer to implement a new process and plan so that we can capture that volume. 

7/9/18 
Customer was fighting through some exisiting inventory on my last vist. David from De Pere expects they should be through their exisiting inventory in a week.
Also, after walking the floor I noticed that they were using Packsize for a couple of cabinets (i.e. lazy susan and a TALL vanity cabinet). Boxing those cabinets will increase their ramp significantly.

Kind of a side note; Ultracraft was acquired by MBCI many years ago and from Cundiff's account it sounded like the Packsize solution kind of got shoved down their throat.

5/29/24 (KES) Onsite introduction meeting with Jasmin, Rhys, and David. Canada site is downsizing and moving lines to Mexico sites. Introduce them to the cloud solution; if all sites can use the same article and design libraries, this would be an almost guaranteed deal. They discovered that they are currently using the machine to batch-produce boxes and may have 3 different sizes (small, medium, and large) to use for product lines. The biggest pushback I feel on not going to the right sizing is from David (R&D), who does not want more work. Discussed the options to integrate and how it would lessen his work to maintain the article database. Interested in an auto ink label solution to apply label data for lines.

2024.06.03. TL :Sales Call - Went over two revised amendment proposals.

TL-12/16/22- Reviewed the $5k/month proposal with Rob and Lauren and they agreed that the best option would be to schedule an uninstall.  I mentioned Packsize NOW being a great fit for what they do and their needs going forward and they were excited at that prospect.  Asked Sales ops to create and uninstall project to schedule. 


TL-12/6/22-Sent over the current state status of revenue and VC to Rob to look over before our conversation next week.  Every Nasco site in operated independently and they have not been close to their VC.

AP - The customer is having a CAPX in the next few months, they should have approval on automation projects by the end of July.
 
4/22/19 LV -  I met with the DMU's at Nasco. The biggest pain point is the Cubiscan machine not able to scan some of the items and creating larger boxes for the smaller products that are using the cubiscan tray for transport. 

I called the hotline and cubiscan and they were not able to identify any issues with the current setup. This is a pain point.

6/6/24 - NJO - We package replacement cabinet doors for this location. In 2023, we completed a packaging redesign with the intention of reducing damage. The project was a great success with less doors being required to re-ship. This, in conjunction with the decline in overall cabinet demand has caused our volume to drop. Good news came in May 2024, where we were informed that an additional 150 doors/day were going to be produced in Gas City - this brings the total count to an average of 700 doors/day which should represent a 27% increase in volume from 2024 average.

Reached out to Danny in December, but it was a difficult month for contact. Followed up in early January with no response.
Recent Interaction:
Danny called today after a belt snapped on one of their machines, requesting a technician on-site. During the conversation, Danny expressed dissatisfaction and mentioned they are likely moving away from Packsize.
Machine Usage Review:
Two of the EM7 units are no longer in use:
One has been ready for uninstallation for some time. The second saw a significant decrease in usage starting in April/May and is now idle.
Stock Box Observations:
Stock boxes were seen on-site in November, which suggests they may have been planning this transition for a while.

A decrease in reboxing has been identified at multiple locations. Brian is actively addressing this issue with each site, and we anticipate an increase in volume as a result. Brian plans to revisit the presentation of the PAAS fee model once the volume improves and cost savings can be demonstrated, as the company is currently focused on cost-saving measures.

CNC is growing and is expanding its operations to Florida and Las Vegas
CNC is also growing its volume in New Jersey
CNC is wary of the potential tariffs with China and has pre purchased a lot of inventory from China
This has caused CNC to intentionally put some vendors on the ""back burner"". I explained that we will hold CNC's orders if we are put on the back burner.

This box is 33% of their overall volume, and while we are more expensive than a stock box, the production/operations team prefer packsize.

2023 Recap AE- Worked directly with Rick Vanyo (now retired), this customer is very picky about including the Veritiv rep in all conversations. We explored moving their current machine to their other facility and adding an additional iQ to gather more share of wallet. There is major potential here if price is right. But with the upcharge Veritiv has on the customer they are continuing to purchase stock boxes for their trading card market. Would recommend exploring some AP for PP and auto sealers. Adding new rep in the contacts. Scott is the new direct sales rep, and Carole is their customer service rep. Please keep into account their rebate per their agreement if they surpass a certain volume (this can be found on the amendment).
